[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): Electron enables the development of desktop applications using web technologies. It brings the power of Node.js and Chromium to build cross-platform apps with ease.

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that empowers developers to rapidly build custom user interfaces. With its extensive set of utility classes, Tailwind CSS enables you to create visually stunning and responsive designs effortlessly.
